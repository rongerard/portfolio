                   Although I had not yet formally graduated and was only waiting for my graduation after completing my OJT, I immediately took charge of all ICT operations with only a 1-day transition, including network management, enrollment systems, account creation, ID processing, and troubleshooting. In my first week, I discovered long-standing network problems caused by outdated unmanaged switches conflicting with VLAN-based equipment. Over 25 days, I mapped the entire network, identified the root causes, replaced incompatible switches with managed Unifi units, and stabilized wireless performance. I also improved enrollment and ID tracking using Excel to organize and manage records. My perseverance and ability to handle pressure were essential in delivering results and establishing a more stable, scalable network foundation despite limited resources and legacy infrastructure.
