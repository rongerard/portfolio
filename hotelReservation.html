                    <p>
                        This project, built during my second year studying BSIT, was developed using Microsoft Visual
                        Studio and C#. It made me realize that our lack of experience in collaboration posed a
                        significant challenge.At this stage, we don’t have a clear plan for the project, but we still
                        assigned tasks to each other in an effort to move forward but we encountered several issues,
                        particularly with the tight two-week deadline our professor gave us. Although we tried to
                        collaborate, I ended up doing most of the work, as my team created a front-end that relied on a
                        complicated plugin. Given the time constraints, I simplified the design to make it more
                        manageable, but didn’t have enough time to fully apply all the changes. Despite not going as
                        planned, this was a valuable learning experience, as it was my first time working on a
                        application project with a team. It taught me the importance of clear communication, realistic
                        planning, effective delegation, and adaptability, all of which are crucial for successful
                        teamwork and time management in future projects.
